# none-ls-php.nvim

Native PHP diagnostic source for none-ls.nvim

Since this diagnostic was deprecated from [none-ls.nvim](https://github.com/nvimtools/none-ls.nvim)
(see [this issue](https://github.com/nvimtools/none-ls.nvim/issues/58)) because a LSP alternative is available,
this repository allows to keep using native php linter with none-ls.nvim.

**Note:** This plugin is not intended to be used alone, it is a dependency of none-ls.nvim.
